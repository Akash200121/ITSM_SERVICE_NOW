2. -->Salesforce (SFDC) - CSM - Customer Service Management 
   --> Workday - HR Management Tool

3. --> Azure 
   --> AWS
   --> GCP 
These are Cloud Tools

4. Service Now 

5. What is a CASE - Reference No - CSM

6. ITIL - Information Technology Infrastructure Library

> ITIL provides us guiding principles or rules for better service delivery.

7. Using the ITIL concept different tools are built, they are called ITSM Tools.

8. Cloud -- CSM(SFDC), HR(Workday), ITSM Tools - Service Now(Market Leader)

9. Magic Quadrent, Gartnere

13. PDI(Lab) - Personal Developer Instance

14. Being a cloud product we can subscribe our access to the Service Now using the platform - developer.servicenow.com

15. Instance means the workspace or Lab Area 




--> Service now is a cloud based platform 
--> We can login to developer.servicenow.com
--> Create our servicenow Id
--> With Service Now ID we will get access to developer platform which is called PDA
--> Along with this we can get access to docs - docs.servicenow.com
--> We will also get access to community - community.servicenow.com
--> Also to the Now Learning - nowlearning.servicenow.com


--> Every year service now has 2 releases.

1. Month of Feb and other in August (Beta) 
2. The different releases are as per the city names across the globe.
3. The naming convention is Alphabetical - Starting with A and now at Tokyo 
4. The previous 2 releases will be available after the current is released.


Future Releases - 

2024 - Washington
2023 - Utah           Vancouver

To change the Instance we can Release the I



--> When we look at the screen after logging in we can see 3 major screens
	- Top is the Header
	- Left side - Filter Navigator  
	- Center - Content Frame


Filter Navigator is generally use to navigate between the application and the modules.

On the Filter Navigator we have different Apps and it in-turn has many Modules

The Content Frame is Dynamic in Nature and shows dynamic data based on the Application or Module


IN THE INSTANCE PORTAL

--Time Zone of the User Profile is very important
--Default Date and Time Format is YYYY-MM-DD
--The Themes can be changed during project 

--> The Database used by ServiveNow is SQL and MariaDB

Chapter 2 - 

Service Now UI
==============

There are two types of UI - 

UI15
UI16

At any point of time you can switch between UI15 and UI16

- Why is it UI 15 and 16 - Service Now UI was released in 2015 - 15 , 2016 - 16 



First Assignment -

my.rebootclub.org


--> Set the theme Bimley
--> Share a SS of that in the LMS

Second Assignment - 

--> Switch to UI 15 and add a Quick link to Edge Area and the quick link must take you to specific App - Incident under the Self Service Application



Important - Basic Configuration 

--> What are the different Areas that need to be customized -
	1. Unique User profile
	2. Theme based on Company Logo color or their work
	3. Give Links to access of various Sub - Departments
	4. Contact Info
	5. Easily accessible UI 


Same question with right answer
	1. Branding - Logo, Theme - colors
	2. Platform Time or Server Time Zones - Timings - based on HQ
	3. Date Format - 
	4. Configuration based on Company


First project

1. Logo - 
2. HQ - Time Zone - NY GMT - 4.00
3. Date we want to implement - YYYY/MM/DD


STEPS -

1. Basic Config UI 16
2. Add the logo 
3. Page Header Caption
4. Date and Time
5. Colour
6. System UI - Theme - It completly depends on the firm's choice of Colours

Chapter 3 - 

USER ADMINISTRATION -
===================

Types of User Administartion - 

1. Creating a User
2. Types of User - EU, Fullfiller, System Admin
3. Roles - Out-of-box Roles, Adding / Removing Roles, Creating a new role, parent/partner Role
4. Groups (Teams)
5. Delegate

How many Users can be there -

1. End Users
2. Resolver, Helpdesk, Technician, Approver,  From Service Now point of view - Fullfiller
3. System Administrator



Life cycle of User journey -
Access can be granted based on the Roles



Admin Activity -

1. First User Creation -
	In navigation type - USERS - CHOOSE ADMINISTRATION USERS
	Select New and typout the details

Important Feature - Impersoante User - You are logging in to that persons profile (impersonate - behaving like that user) - few have been given access like Admins and few others
=================   ================ 


HOMEWORK
--------
1. Create the USER 
2. Impersonate User
3. Check what are the application access the User has


- The User does not have - 
My Approvals
App Engine Studio
Benchmarks
Business Calendar
Entity View Action Mapper
Guided Setup ......


The End User will have access to only self service portal.
Impersonate User
System Administrator


25/08/2022
----------


-->VM - virtual Machine , when we dont use it for more than 10 hours the instance sleeps

Tabs in the Service Now Portal of a User is called Related List
Second one is called Roles
The general Role is ITIL
Adding the Role we also get many roles 

1. Whenever we add a role applications related to that role are accessed by the user
2. Different roles are present in the system - whenever a role is added access related to that application is provided

Types of Roles and their uses

Just like OOPS - Inheritance where Child Inherits Parents Features 
Similarly here we have Partner Roles
                       --------------

ITIL Role can be performed by Help Desk 



Assignment - 

1. There is a team and it works on Assets and also works for Reporting

What are the Roles avaailable in the system

Answers

Search for Assets
and then for the Reporting - we choose report user


--> The Reporting role will help us give report of our work to manager, or report 



VNAVALEVENKATESHA@Deloitte.com	


Create a role and the role name is Asset Management , they should be able to work with Assets, Incidents, Change, Problem, Configuration Items

The original answer is only adding ITIL role and then Asset as all the roles are already present in ITIL

At times we must use User roles as they have less accesibilty and only the important stuffs to be managed can be given to Admin

Adding Approver user and Antvirus Admin

--> There is a role called Impersonator which when given to a user allows to impersonate any user, but this does not mean it will allow him to impersonate the System Administrator


--> Team  Creation - Group 
How a team or group can be created 

--> One way to give roles is to create a new role and assign to each user

--> Other way is to create a new group - 

	> Create the group
	> Add members
	> Add the role to the group 
	> Expectation - 
			>> Roles will be inherited to the user profile
			>> Once a user is removed from the group Roles will be disassociated


>>> We can create a group and add the members and also add roles for the group 
We can as well create a Child Group
>>> User can belong to one or more groups



Assignment ---


1. Create a New Group
2. Company - REBOOT INC
	CEO - ABRAHAM LINCOLN
3. Department - Reboot Software
	Role - ITIL
	Members any 3
4. Development Team - 
	>> Testing Team
	>> Project Management Team


The members can also have extra roles other than the group roles

--> Delegate
    ========

>> Abraham Lincoln is going on vacation and he wants to make Abel Tuter as his delegate during this period.

	>>> Go to the user profile of the user Abraham Lincoln and then add the Delegate and choose what all the specific user chosen on behalf can handle.
	>>> The timing of Delegate can be modified and then the person will not have access to the given tasks
	>>> One or more persons can be made to delegate tasks

The admin can also delegate the task of other users.

Only the Admin has access to User Database



--> Understand LDAP and SSO

There are three other ways to create the account - 
	1. Manual Creation
	2. Data Load
	3. Integration with the External Sources -
		1. LDAP
		2. SSO

LDAP is also called Active Directory

---> LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

It has a Integration with ServiceNow - and every few organizations have bidirectional 
It is like a central repository wherein if the user is created at LDAP then it is also created and synced in SN

Integration is Data Population and Authentication 

That is it does not ask for password because it checks directly in the database for the user id



---> SSO - Single Sign On it uses a SAML(SSO Provider) This does not need a password but checks the directory for the email you have provided


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4 -

LIST ADMINISTRATION -
===================

1. What is a list ? - The lists of the records present in the table or under an application are listed in the form of rows and columns

>> Each column is a field in the table / form
>> Each row is a record in the table

>>Sorting - We can sort the data by just clicking on the column header.

>>Personalize list - Through this we can add or remove fields and also manage which format it should appear




>>> Assignment -

Show all the users who belongs to company ACME - Australia


Wildcard - When trying to search for some keyword but you are only aware of the partial keyword, then you can use wilcard and in serviceNow the wildcard is "*" 

Ex - *aus



>>> Show all the users who belongs to ACME Australia or ACME North America 
	Choose the filter option and mention the department in which we have to apply the filter, we can also save this and use it for future and also control who can view this.



Assignment -

Create a filter for SND Group:
filter on execution should show all users who belongs to company ACME NA and department IT or Sales.
Exclude Inactive Users

Answer - 
Create a filter and save it and give view access to SND group
Before this the role of the SND Group must be given as admin



>>Show matching - Will show similar kind of record 
  -------------

>>Filter Out - Will remove similar kind of records from the list view
  ----------



---> The record that have been filtered that many records will be downloaded while exporting




Assignment -

>> Exercise - Pull a report of all the users which are not VIP and belongs to company ACME China or ACME Italy

This report must be in PDF

>> List all the users present by company or how many users present by company - This can be done by using Group By feature

>> For showing more results per page click top left three lines and then show option

>>Show 30,60,150,200,250,500 results per page - 
	Go to UI Properties and see in Comma seperated... and enter the numbers and Save it


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 5 -

SERVICENOW ARCHITECTURE
=======================


>> Types of Cloud Offering -

	>> Three types -

		1. SaaS - Software as a Service - 
			Example  - Gmail, Office 365, FB .....
			Limitation - You cannot customize
			
 
		2. PaaS - Platform as a Service(SaaS + customization capability) - 
			Example  -  ServiceNow, SFDC ...


		3. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service - 
			Example - AWS, Azure, GCP 


Application Platform as a Service is a sub of PaaS 

ServiceNow's System of Action - 

> Cloud Service
> Now Platform 
> Nonstop Cloud 

>> Single System of engagement for the enterprise



--> Single Data Model - 

--> We have 1 platform, 1 Data Model and Many Products
--> This platform has a capability of integrating with any platform to deliver business solutions.



---> Multi Instance -
     --------------

Minimum 3 instances - 

	Production Instance
	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Instance 
	DEV Instance 

The development will happen in a two phase (i.e) Development will start at one phase and go to the other phase

First will start at Dev Instance then UAT testing which will be done by the Testing Team and at the last the production Instance where it will GO Live which the end user will receive

Here In UAT many different types of Testing happens like Unit Testing, Black Box, UI/UX testing, Browser Testing, and other testing as well. 

--> Bug fixes can be done by Patch Fix or Hot Fix


Architecture of the Multi Instance-
 
First Layer - HARDWARE
Second Layer 	- VM
             	- OS
				- Middle Ware
	     		- Application 


-->> In the Organization we have multiple Instance which follows the 3 Instances

-->> Each Instance has its own software stack but can communicate between each other

-->> Data is truly isolated(easier maintenance) which means that when performing action or updates in other instance it doesnt affect the other 2 instance

-->> Architecture for that is similar to MI but the Hardware serves as a common base and rest 4 layers are split into three for the three instances


NO DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING HAPPENS IN THE PRODUCTION INSTANCE
=============================================================


Instance is a URL

India's nearest data center is SEOUL and Singapore

New has been introduced in Banglore and Mumbai



11 - Pairs of Data Center is 22 Data Center
Main thing in cloud is Availablity

They have introduced a concept called High Availablity Pair

Same copies available on both the side of the DC
If either one of it is facing issues users will be shifted to the other DC without their Knowledge and Business remains unaffected.

User - Internet - Load Balancer - 2 App server - Database, this is replicated on the other DC as well


HI PORTAL - Support page of serviceNow - hi.servicenow.com
========= 

To check the Ram Size, etc... in the serviceNow add Stats Application to bookmark



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 6 - 

DEVELOPMENT
===========


Different types of Tables both Frontend and Backend, Forms and Application

--> Incident - It is a Break Fix Scenario 
	       Something was working but suddenly stopped working and encountered an issue(not working anymore)
	       Should be resolved quickly
How quickly ?
This is called SLA - Service Level Agreement 
This quickness depends on the priority which is the deciding factor

Examples - Unable to login, 100 unwanted Emails Received, My outlook does not load Emails since last 1 hour

>> Whenever there is a Break Fix Scenario then a ticket is logged - 

			>>> Different types of Tickets - 
			The first four are the primary as per ITSM -

					1. Incident
					2. Change
					3. Request
					4. Problem
					5. Task .....


-->>Incident Management 
    -------------------


Creation of User - ID  just like creating a new user and then put password and save then give a role


26/08/2022
----------

-->> OOTB - Out of the box - coming with the Features part of the product

Admin work cannot be delegated 

Work that can be done by Delegate is -
		1. Approval
		2. Assignment
		3. All Notification
		4. Meeting Invitation


>>> To know which user has logged in - Search for User admin and selet Logged in Users module from the List

---> Security Admin Role

		>> This is under the elevate role in the logged in user drop down
		>> This is only for admin
		>> Used to work with access control
		>> This is a temporary role - like only till the user is logged in and is actively working 
		   Basically a "Session Specific Privilege"


-->> Types of Scenarios when this Incidents can be used - 
	Incident option will be available under Muliple application -
		1. Self Service - Without service Desk user can create a ticket without approaching the Service Desk
		2. Service Desk - 
							More field are there to fill out 
							Those with a Star are mandatory fields
							The Number/Case Id cannot be changed except for the admin
							
		>> Priority = Impact + Urgency 

		The Level of Urgency and Impact together which forms the priority is called Priority Matrix

		P-1 or Priority 1 - Critical "Immediate Action"
		P-2 or Priority 2 - High 
		P-3 or Priority 3 - Moderate
		P-4 or Priority 4 - Low 
		P-5 or Priority 5 - Planning 

The Caller is the End User from this we can have access to User directory
Similarly the Assignment Group also has access to the User Groups - Admin Database and the Assigned shows the members in the group

>> Incident Life cycle - 

	The states that it goes Through - 
	If the State is in "New" then it means that the case has been registered recently
	If the State is "In Progress" that means the Incident is acknowledged (Response SLA)
	If the State is "On Hold" that means the SLA has been stopped temporarily(paused) - In this case the person who is assigned to this case has to give a Work Note
	If the State is "Canceled" that means the Ticket has been Canceled
	If the State is "Resolved" that menas the Case has been solved

	Any Incident that has been resolved can be reopened with a specific time frame(In Progress)


To record what the assigned person is doing they make -
	Work Notes 
	Additional Comment - this additional comment is also visible to the user

	To add other people who must be aware of this case then we can add them to our -
				1. Watch List  - Will be aware of all the updates thats going on with the case
				2. Work Notes List - Will be aware only of the Work Notes updates

	When the case has been given resolved then the assigned person must update in "Resolution Information" as well as the Work Notes and the Watch List
		- Mandatory to enter Resolution Code

>> Work Note is Mandatory for all the updates done

>> Crating a Priority Matrix in the Excel 

>> Refresh Feature - If other user has upated some ticket then, the symbols of the areas that were changed will look like a hearbeat
>> Connect Chat - In which anyone can chat with the online users

--> Connect Chart - It serves the purpose of chatting and sharing Information
--> Incedent History Detail - With this we can find the History of the whole Ticket, only accessible ITIL and Admin (To be checked)

--> Email Configuration - 
		Inbound Configuration
		Outbound Configuration

--> In the More options we have an option of Email where in we can mail directly about this issue to the concerned person 
--> Features like - Email, call etc.. can be modified
--> Only Admin and the assigned person to handle the Ticket can change the ticket Number (To be checked)


29/08/2022
----------

--> Difference between Watch List and Work Note List

Watch List - Any Update or modification happens on any field, everyone will receive this Notification who are added to the Watch List
Work Note List - Notification will be sent to people who are added to the Work Note List whenever there is a New Work Note or Additional comment added


--> For Priority 1 Crtitcal - the time can be 1 Hour Response and Resolution can be 1 or 2 hours, this depends on the Company

--> Comapny who is seeking for Service is the company and those in the company using that service is the Customer User 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 7

SLM - SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT
==============================

--> What is SLA? Understanding SLA
--> Types of SLA -
--> Examples


	(A)	-> SLA - Service Level Agreement
		-> This is the 1st type of SLM
		-> It is between 2 Parties -
				- Customer(In Incident Field it is called - Caller)
				- Service Provider
		
		-> SLA can be Configured for each - 
				- Team(Group)
				- Department
				- whole Company
		

	(B) -> OLA - Operational Level Agreement
		-> This is the 2nd type of SLM
		-> Agreement between 2 Parties within the same organization
		-> Example - 
				- Sales team and Delivery Team
				- L & D Team and the project 


	(C) -> UC - Under Pinning Contract
		-> This is the 3rd type of SLM
		-> A Contract is Signed between 3 Parties
		-> There are 3 parties involved - 
				- Customer
				- Service Provider
				- Contractor
		-> There will be an Agreement between A & B 
				another Agreement between B & C
				But C is bound by the agreement between A & B

			There is a direct agreement between A & B and also B & C, but C is indirectly bound by this agreement


>> SLA, OLA, UC - practically no differnce but based on the contract they have to be bifurcated

>> The SLA, OLA and UC comes under SLM (Service Level Management)


--> Use of SLA - It is used for accountability for the Service Provider and if this is breached the Service Provider must pay 

--> Use Case -  
		Any Incident assigned to the Hardware team with Priority P2, must be resolved within 2 mins

Solution -

	Open New SLA --> Give the name as Hardware SLA Team --> Target - Resolution --> Change Duration --> 
		Group select - assignment group - Hardware
		In Start Condition - Assignment group is Hardware and Priority is P2
		In Pause Condition - Incident State is one-of On Hold or Resolved
		In Stop Condition  - Incident State is Closed

	Create a new Incident and Assign it to Hardware Team and group, set priority to 2 and save
	Try changing the State of Incident to On Hold or Resolved to see if the SLA is getting paused


--> NEW SLA - 
	1. Schedule - Working hours of the team is put under the Schedule
				  For testing it is not possible to give Schedule Timing as the Server is based on US Time Zone

	2. Start Condition - Condition in the problem statement

	3. The pause condition will be paused in two situations - 1. On Hold and 2. Resolved
			Here the Incident State is one of On Hold or resolved

	4. The Stop Condition will be stopped when the state is Closed




Assignment -

Create OLA for the IT Department 
Any Incident assigned to IT Department/ACME Australia and Software Group must be responded within 5 Mins and resolved within 10 mins

Time - 20 mins and Marks - 20


Solution - 

	Open new SLA --> Give any name IT DEPT --> Here we have two Targets so we create two SLA - 1. Response 2. Resolution 
	--> Set Duration accordingly --> Group Select - Software 

	--> Start Condition - Company ACME Australia and Assigned Group Software 
	--> Pause and Stop Conditon same as earlier


	Create an Incident -

	In Incident we may not be able to see the Company Box for that - 
			-- Right Click near the Incident and then choose Configure and then Search for Company and Drag and Drop and then Save, now choose company and Assigned group accordingly




Schedule - Working hours of the team


HOMEWORK -

Create a Schedule for 9 - 6 Weekdays excluding holidays as per Indian Calendar from August to December

Solution -



ITSM SUITS - 

1. Incident Management
2. Service Level Management
3. Problem Management
4. Knowledge Management
5. Change Management
6. Service Request
7. Asset Management

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 8

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT 
==================

When do we need a problem ticket ?

	- A repeatitive issue
	- Frequently Issue is reported or reoccured
	- Vendor Dependency

One Problem - prerequisite 
Then based on the existing Incident


>> TO create a Problem go to that particular Incident and right click on the top and choose Create Problem 

--> Life Cycle Of a Problem 
		- New
		- Assess
		- Root Cause Analysis 
		- Fix in Progress
		- Resolved
		- Closed

>> In the Assess - In this stage the problem is Assigned to the Problem manager
>> If it is a PROBLEM the Problem Manager accepts or declines the Problem or terms as Duplicate
>> Root Cause Analysis - Analysing the Root Cause of the Problem
>> Resolve - Solving the Problem
>> Closed - The Problem is Closed
>> If we face any issues again then the Problem can be re-analysed
>> Similar Incidents can be added to Child Incidents and when the Incident is closed then all the Child Incidents are closed



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 9

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
====================


--> Benefit of Knowledge Management -
		- Knowledge Article(KA) helps Resolver team to Resolve Incidents Faster
		- KA are grouped under the Knowledge Base(KB)
		- KA Publish / Retire needs Approval


--> Use Case -
	Create a Knowledge Base : Deloitte ServiceNow Training
	Owner of this Knowledge - Uchiha Itachi

	Create Knowledge Article : Deloite ITSM Training

	We are going to learn : How to create and How to Use?

	To create this knowledge article choose the Knowledge Base first and then and then add here the 


Assignment =
		Create a Knowledge article for the the Java Instation Issue - 
		It should be placed under the IT - Java Category 
		Create and Publish --> Test and Confirm


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 10

CHANGE MANAGEMENT
=================

>> When there is an Infrastructure Change then Change Management comes into play 
>> In this case we need to perform Impact Analyses
>> Sometimes there may be a cost associated with it
>> Need Approval as well

-->> Types of Change Management -
	(A) Normal Change - Approval Needed
	(B) Standard Change - Pre Approved
	(C) Emergency Change - Approval Needed

--> Life Cycle of Change Request

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       
       Type             |       Normal        |      Emergency    |     Standard      |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Assess Phase - in the Normal Change is the Technical Approval, that is if the change is technically possible or not
until the confirmation of the Assignment Group 
CAB - Change Advisory Board 

>> Steps for Normal Change -
	- We have to enter data in the necessary fields and also select the Assignment Group 
	- We have to give the Short description / description 
	- Next is the Assess stage in which we have to wait for the approval 
				- Here we need to provide the Justification, Implementation Plan, Risk and Impact analysis, Backout Plan(Rollback Options), Test Plan
				These are mandatory fields
	- Requesting Approval - CAB Approval
	- Scheduled - Start and End Date and Time
	- Implement - We have to implement and take pictures or screenshots of the change done
	- Review - The Change will get reviewed and then it will go to the closure
	- Close - The Update is closed and the Closure Information has to be provided 
	- Canceled - If the Change was not successful then we can cancel the change and Rollback


>> Emergency Change
	- After Creating a Change Request
	- We directly go to the Approval Stage instead of the Assess Stage
	- After the CAB approval other stages similar to that of Normal Change


>> Standard Change
	- We already have few Templates
	- For New Templates - Go to Standard Change and choose My Proposal -> New
	- Create the template and Fill all the Change Request Values
	- The next Stage is the approval stage 
	- After the approval the template can be found in the New Change


>>> Standard change means there is no business impact
		Example - Someone asks for changing his own password, this does not affect the business
