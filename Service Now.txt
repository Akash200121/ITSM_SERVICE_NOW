Chapter 1 -

BASIC TERMINOLOGIES AND INTRO TO SERVICENOW 
===========================================


1. Cloud - Data center - when large amount of servers are placed.

2. -->Salesforce (SFDC) - CSM - Customer Service Management 
   --> Workday - HR Management Tool

3. --> Azure 
   --> AWS
   --> GCP 
These are Cloud Tools

4. Service Now 

5. What is a CASE - Reference No - CSM

6. ITIL - Information Technology Infrastructure Library

> ITIL provides us guiding principles or rules for better service delivery.

7. Using the ITIL concept different tools are built, they are called ITSM Tools.

8. Cloud -- CSM(SFDC), HR(Workday), ITSM Tools - Service Now(Market Leader)

9. Magic Quadrent, Gartnere

10. On-premises(Self hosted) - Physical Servers 

11. Service Now is a Cloud Based Software

12. ITSM - Information Technology Service Management

13. PDI(Lab) - Personal Developer Instance

14. Being a cloud product we can subscribe our access to the Service Now using the platform - developer.servicenow.com

15. Instance means the workspace or Lab Area 




--> Service now is a cloud based platform 
--> We can login to developer.servicenow.com
--> Create our servicenow Id
--> With Service Now ID we will get access to developer platform which is called PDA
--> Along with this we can get access to docs - docs.servicenow.com
--> We will also get access to community - community.servicenow.com
--> Also to the Now Learning - nowlearning.servicenow.com


--> Every year service now has 2 releases.

1. Month of Feb and other in August (Beta) 
2. The different releases are as per the city names across the globe.
3. The naming convention is Alphabetical - Starting with A and now at Tokyo 
4. The previous 2 releases will be available after the current is released.


Future Releases - 

2024 - Washington
2023 - Utah           Vancouver
2022 - Tokyo          Sandiego
2021 - Rome           Quebec


History 

This is company was started with a different nae as Glide Software in the year 2006 by Fred Luddy
In 2011 the name was released as Service Now
In 2019 Bill McDermott joined from SAP as CEO
High Market Share 

Release alphabets

A - Aspen, B- Berlin, etc...


To change the Instance we can Release the I



--> When we look at the screen after logging in we can see 3 major screens
	- Top is the Header
	- Left side - Filter Navigator  
	- Center - Content Frame


Filter Navigator is generally use to navigate between the application and the modules.

On the Filter Navigator we have different Apps and it in-turn has many Modules

The Content Frame is Dynamic in Nature and shows dynamic data based on the Application or Module

The Application name is typed with an 's' as it has to be in plural form


IN THE INSTANCE PORTAL

--Time Zone of the User Profile is very important
--Default Date and Time Format is YYYY-MM-DD
--The Themes can be changed during project 

--> The Database used by ServiveNow is SQL and MariaDB

Chapter 2 - 

Service Now UI
==============

There are two types of UI - 

UI15
UI16

At any point of time you can switch between UI15 and UI16

- Why is it UI 15 and 16 - Service Now UI was released in 2015 - 15 , 2016 - 16 



First Assignment -

my.rebootclub.org


--> Set the theme Bimley
--> Share a SS of that in the LMS

Second Assignment - 

--> Switch to UI 15 and add a Quick link to Edge Area and the quick link must take you to specific App - Incident under the Self Service Application



Important - Basic Configuration 

--> What are the different Areas that need to be customized -
	1. Unique User profile
	2. Theme based on Company Logo color or their work
	3. Give Links to access of various Sub - Departments
	4. Contact Info
	5. Easily accessible UI 


Same question with right answer
	1. Branding - Logo, Theme - colors
	2. Platform Time or Server Time Zones - Timings - based on HQ
	3. Date Format - 
	4. Configuration based on Company


First project

1. Logo - 
2. HQ - Time Zone - NY GMT - 4.00
3. Date we want to implement - YYYY/MM/DD


STEPS -

1. Basic Config UI 16
2. Add the logo 
3. Page Header Caption
4. Date and Time
5. Colour
6. System UI - Theme - It completly depends on the firm's choice of Colours

Chapter 3 - 

USER ADMINISTRATION -
===================

Types of User Administartion - 

1. Creating a User
2. Types of User - EU, Fullfiller, System Admin
3. Roles - Out-of-box Roles, Adding / Removing Roles, Creating a new role, parent/partner Role
4. Groups (Teams)
5. Delegate

How many Users can be there -

1. End Users
2. Resolver, Helpdesk, Technician, Approver,  From Service Now point of view - Fullfiller
3. System Administrator



Life cycle of User journey -
Access can be granted based on the Roles



Admin Activity -

1. First User Creation -
	In navigation type - USERS - CHOOSE ADMINISTRATION USERS
	Select New and typout the details

Important Feature - Impersoante User - You are logging in to that persons profile (impersonate - behaving like that user) - few have been given access like Admins and few others
=================   ================ 


HOMEWORK
--------
1. Create the USER 
2. Impersonate User
3. Check what are the application access the User has


- The User does not have - 
My Approvals
App Engine Studio
Benchmarks
Business Calendar
Entity View Action Mapper
Guided Setup ......


The End User will have access to only self service portal.
Impersonate User
System Administrator


25/08/2022
----------


-->VM - virtual Machine , when we dont use it for more than 10 hours the instance sleeps

Tabs in the Service Now Portal of a User is called Related List
Second one is called Roles
The general Role is ITIL
Adding the Role we also get many roles 

1. Whenever we add a role applications related to that role are accessed by the user
2. Different roles are present in the system - whenever a role is added access related to that application is provided

Types of Roles and their uses

Just like OOPS - Inheritance where Child Inherits Parents Features 
Similarly here we have Partner Roles
                       --------------

ITIL Role can be performed by Help Desk 



Assignment - 

1. There is a team and it works on Assets and also works for Reporting

What are the Roles available in the system

Answers

Search for Assets
and then for the Reporting - we choose report user


--> The Reporting role will help us give report of our work to manager, or report 



VNAVALEVENKATESHA@Deloitte.com	


Create a role and the role name is Asset Management , they should be able to work with Assets, Incidents, Change, Problem, Configuration Items

The original answer is only adding ITIL role and then Asset as all the roles are already present in ITIL

At times we must use User roles as they have less accesibilty and only the important stuffs to be managed can be given to Admin

Adding Approver user and Antvirus Admin

--> There is a role called Impersonator which when given to a user allows to impersonate any user, but this does not mean it will allow him to impersonate the System Administrator


--> Team  Creation - Group 
How a team or group can be created 

--> One way to give roles is to create a new role and assign to each user

--> Other way is to create a new group - 

	> Create the group
	> Add members
	> Add the role to the group 
	> Expectation - 
			>> Roles will be inherited to the user profile
			>> Once a user is removed from the group Roles will be disassociated


>>> We can create a group and add the members and also add roles for the group 
We can as well create a Child Group
>>> User can belong to one or more groups



Assignment ---


1. Create a New Group
2. Company - REBOOT INC
	CEO - ABRAHAM LINCOLN
3. Department - Reboot Software
	Role - ITIL
	Members any 3
4. Development Team - 
	>> Testing Team
	>> Project Management Team


The members can also have extra roles other than the group roles

--> Delegate
    ========

>> Abraham Lincoln is going on vacation and he wants to make Abel Tuter as his delegate during this period.

	>>> Go to the user profile of the user Abraham Lincoln and then add the Delegate and choose what all the specific user chosen on behalf can handle.
	>>> The timing of Delegate can be modified and then the person will not have access to the given tasks
	>>> One or more persons can be made to delegate tasks

The admin can also delegate the task of other users.

Only the Admin has access to User Database



--> Understand LDAP and SSO

There are three other ways to create the account - 
	1. Manual Creation
	2. Data Load
	3. Integration with the External Sources -
		1. LDAP
		2. SSO

LDAP is also called Active Directory

---> LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

It has a Integration with ServiceNow - and every few organizations have bidirectional 
It is like a central repository wherein if the user is created at LDAP then it is also created and synced in SN

Integration is Data Population and Authentication 

That is it does not ask for password because it checks directly in the database for the user id



---> SSO - Single Sign On it uses a SAML(SSO Provider) This does not need a password but checks the directory for the email you have provided


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 4 -

LIST ADMINISTRATION -
===================

1. What is a list ? - The lists of the records present in the table or under an application are listed in the form of rows and columns

>> Each column is a field in the table / form
>> Each row is a record in the table

>>Sorting - We can sort the data by just clicking on the column header.

>>Personalize list - Through this we can add or remove fields and also manage which format it should appear




>>> Assignment -

Show all the users who belongs to company ACME - Australia


Wildcard - When trying to search for some keyword but you are only aware of the partial keyword, then you can use wilcard and in serviceNow the wildcard is "*" 

Ex - *aus



>>> Show all the users who belongs to ACME Australia or ACME North America 
	Choose the filter option and mention the department in which we have to apply the filter, we can also save this and use it for future and also control who can view this.



Assignment -

Create a filter for SND Group:
filter on execution should show all users who belongs to company ACME NA and department IT or Sales.
Exclude Inactive Users

Answer - 
Create a filter and save it and give view access to SND group
Before this the role of the SND Group must be given as admin



>>Show matching - Will show similar kind of record 
  -------------

>>Filter Out - Will remove similar kind of records from the list view
  ----------



---> The record that have been filtered that many records will be downloaded while exporting




Assignment -

>> Exercise - Pull a report of all the users which are not VIP and belongs to company ACME China or ACME Italy

This report must be in PDF

>> List all the users present by company or how many users present by company - This can be done by using Group By feature

>> For showing more results per page click top left three lines and then show option

>>Show 30,60,150,200,250,500 results per page - 
	Go to UI Properties and see in Comma seperated... and enter the numbers and Save it


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 5 -

SERVICENOW ARCHITECTURE
=======================


>> Types of Cloud Offering -

	>> Three types -

		1. SaaS - Software as a Service - 
			Example  - Gmail, Office 365, FB .....
			Limitation - You cannot customize
			
 
		2. PaaS - Platform as a Service(SaaS + customization capability) - 
			Example  -  ServiceNow, SFDC ...


		3. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service - 
			Example - AWS, Azure, GCP 


Application Platform as a Service is a sub of PaaS 

ServiceNow's System of Action - 

> Cloud Service
> Now Platform 
> Nonstop Cloud 

>> Single System of engagement for the enterprise



--> Single Data Model - 

--> We have 1 platform, 1 Data Model and Many Products
--> This platform has a capability of integrating with any platform to deliver business solutions.



---> Multi Instance -
     --------------

Minimum 3 instances - 

	Production Instance
	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Instance 
	DEV Instance 

The development will happen in a two phase (i.e) Development will start at one phase and go to the other phase

First will start at Dev Instance then UAT testing which will be done by the Testing Team and at the last the production Instance where it will GO Live which the end user will receive

Here In UAT many different types of Testing happens like Unit Testing, Black Box, UI/UX testing, Browser Testing, and other testing as well. 

If there is any problem in the Production stage it again enters the Development Stage and 
--> Bug fixes can be done by Patch Fix or Hot Fix


Architecture of the Multi Instance-
 
First Layer - HARDWARE
Second Layer 	- VM
             	- OS
				- Middle Ware
	     		- Application 


-->> In the Organization we have multiple Instance which follows the 3 Instances

-->> Each Instance has its own software stack but can communicate between each other

-->> Data is truly isolated(easier maintenance) which means that when performing action or updates in other instance it doesnt affect the other 2 instance

-->> Architecture for that is similar to MI but the Hardware serves as a common base and rest 4 layers are split into three for the three instances


NO DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING HAPPENS IN THE PRODUCTION INSTANCE
=============================================================


Instance is a URL

India's nearest data center is SEOUL and Singapore

New has been introduced in Banglore and Mumbai



11 - Pairs of Data Center is 22 Data Center
Main thing in cloud is Availablity

They have introduced a concept called High Availablity Pair

Same copies available on both the side of the DC
If either one of it is facing issues users will be shifted to the other DC without their Knowledge and Business remains unaffected.

User - Internet - Load Balancer - 2 App server - Database, this is replicated on the other DC as well


HI PORTAL - Support page of serviceNow - hi.servicenow.com
========= 

To check the Ram Size, etc... in the serviceNow add Stats Application to bookmark



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 6 - 

DEVELOPMENT
===========


Different types of Tables both Frontend and Backend, Forms and Application

--> Incident - It is a Break Fix Scenario 
	       Something was working but suddenly stopped working and encountered an issue(not working anymore)
	       Should be resolved quickly
How quickly ?
This is called SLA - Service Level Agreement 
This quickness depends on the priority which is the deciding factor

Examples - Unable to login, 100 unwanted Emails Received, My outlook does not load Emails since last 1 hour

>> Whenever there is a Break Fix Scenario then a ticket is logged - 

			>>> Different types of Tickets - 
			The first four are the primary as per ITSM -

					1. Incident
					2. Change
					3. Request
					4. Problem
					5. Task .....


-->>Incident Management 
    -------------------


Creation of User - ID  just like creating a new user and then put password and save then give a role


26/08/2022
----------

-->> OOTB - Out of the box - coming with the Features part of the product

Admin work cannot be delegated 

Work that can be done by Delegate is -
		1. Approval
		2. Assignment
		3. All Notification
		4. Meeting Invitation


>>> To know which user has logged in - Search for User admin and selet Logged in Users module from the List

---> Security Admin Role

		>> This is under the elevate role in the logged in user drop down
		>> This is only for admin
		>> Used to work with access control
		>> This is a temporary role - like only till the user is logged in and is actively working 
		   Basically a "Session Specific Privilege"


-->> Types of Scenarios when this Incidents can be used - 
	Incident option will be available under Muliple application -
		1. Self Service - Without service Desk user can create a ticket without approaching the Service Desk
		2. Service Desk - 
							More field are there to fill out 
							Those with a Star are mandatory fields
							The Number/Case Id cannot be changed except for the admin
							
		>> Priority = Impact + Urgency 

		The Level of Urgency and Impact together which forms the priority is called Priority Matrix

		P-1 or Priority 1 - Critical "Immediate Action"
		P-2 or Priority 2 - High 
		P-3 or Priority 3 - Moderate
		P-4 or Priority 4 - Low 
		P-5 or Priority 5 - Planning 

The Caller is the End User from this we can have access to User directory
Similarly the Assignment Group also has access to the User Groups - Admin Database and the Assigned shows the members in the group

>> Incident Life cycle - 

	The states that it goes Through - 
	If the State is in "New" then it means that the case has been registered recently
	If the State is "In Progress" that means the Incident is acknowledged (Response SLA)
	If the State is "On Hold" that means the SLA has been stopped temporarily(paused) - In this case the person who is assigned to this case has to give a Work Note
	If the State is "Canceled" that means the Ticket has been Canceled
	If the State is "Resolved" that menas the Case has been solved

	Any Incident that has been resolved can be reopened with a specific time frame(In Progress)


To record what the assigned person is doing they make -
	Work Notes 
	Additional Comment - this additional comment is also visible to the user

	To add other people who must be aware of this case then we can add them to our -
				1. Watch List  - Will be aware of all the updates thats going on with the case
				2. Work Notes List - Will be aware only of the Work Notes updates

	When the case has been given resolved then the assigned person must update in "Resolution Information" as well as the Work Notes and the Watch List
		- Mandatory to enter Resolution Code

>> Work Note is Mandatory for all the updates done

>> Crating a Priority Matrix in the Excel 

>> Refresh Feature - If other user has upated some ticket then, the symbols of the areas that were changed will look like a hearbeat
>> Connect Chat - In which anyone can chat with the online users

--> Connect Chart - It serves the purpose of chatting and sharing Information
--> Incedent History Detail - With this we can find the History of the whole Ticket, only accessible ITIL and Admin (To be checked)

--> Email Configuration - 
		Inbound Configuration
		Outbound Configuration

--> In the More options we have an option of Email where in we can mail directly about this issue to the concerned person 
--> Features like - Email, call etc.. can be modified
--> Only Admin and the assigned person to handle the Ticket can change the ticket Number (To be checked)


29/08/2022
----------

--> Difference between Watch List and Work Note List

Watch List - Any Update or modification happens on any field, everyone will receive this Notification who are added to the Watch List
Work Note List - Notification will be sent to people who are added to the Work Note List whenever there is a New Work Note or Additional comment added


--> For Priority 1 Crtitcal - the time can be 1 Hour Response and Resolution can be 1 or 2 hours, this depends on the Company

--> Comapny who is seeking for Service is the company and those in the company using that service is the Customer User 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 7

SLM - SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT
==============================

--> What is SLA? Understanding SLA
--> Types of SLA -
--> Examples


	(A)	-> SLA - Service Level Agreement
		-> This is the 1st type of SLM
		-> It is between 2 Parties -
				- Customer(In Incident Field it is called - Caller)
				- Service Provider
		
		-> SLA can be Configured for each - 
				- Team(Group)
				- Department
				- whole Company
		

	(B) -> OLA - Operational Level Agreement
		-> This is the 2nd type of SLM
		-> Agreement between 2 Parties within the same organization
		-> Example - 
				- Sales team and Delivery Team
				- L & D Team and the project 


	(C) -> UC - Under Pinning Contract
		-> This is the 3rd type of SLM
		-> A Contract is Signed between 3 Parties
		-> There are 3 parties involved - 
				- Customer
				- Service Provider
				- Contractor
		-> There will be an Agreement between A & B 
				another Agreement between B & C
				But C is bound by the agreement between A & B

			There is a direct agreement between A & B and also B & C, but C is indirectly bound by this agreement


>> SLA, OLA, UC - practically no differnce but based on the contract they have to be bifurcated

>> The SLA, OLA and UC comes under SLM (Service Level Management)


--> Use of SLA - It is used for accountability for the Service Provider and if this is breached the Service Provider must pay 

--> Use Case -  
		Any Incident assigned to the Hardware team with Priority P2, must be resolved within 2 mins

Solution -

	Open New SLA --> Give the name as Hardware SLA Team --> Target - Resolution --> Change Duration --> 
		Group select - assignment group - Hardware
		In Start Condition - Assignment group is Hardware and Priority is P2
		In Pause Condition - Incident State is one-of On Hold or Resolved
		In Stop Condition  - Incident State is Closed

	Create a new Incident and Assign it to Hardware Team and group, set priority to 2 and save
	Try changing the State of Incident to On Hold or Resolved to see if the SLA is getting paused


--> NEW SLA - 
	1. Schedule - Working hours of the team is put under the Schedule
				  For testing it is not possible to give Schedule Timing as the Server is based on US Time Zone

	2. Start Condition - Condition in the problem statement

	3. The pause condition will be paused in two situations - 1. On Hold and 2. Resolved
			Here the Incident State is one of On Hold or resolved

	4. The Stop Condition will be stopped when the state is Closed




Assignment -

Create OLA for the IT Department 
Any Incident assigned to IT Department/ACME Australia and Software Group must be responded within 5 Mins and resolved within 10 mins

Time - 20 mins and Marks - 20


Solution - 

	Open new SLA --> Give any name IT DEPT --> Here we have two Targets so we create two SLA - 1. Response 2. Resolution 
	--> Set Duration accordingly --> Group Select - Software 

	--> Start Condition - Company ACME Australia and Assigned Group Software 
	--> Pause and Stop Conditon same as earlier


	Create an Incident -

	In Incident we may not be able to see the Company Box for that - 
			-- Right Click near the Incident and then choose Configure and then Search for Company and Drag and Drop and then Save, now choose company and Assigned group accordingly




Schedule - Working hours of the team
		 - Outside the Scheduled time SLA wont be attached to the ticket

HOMEWORK -

Create a Schedule for 9 - 6 Weekdays excluding holidays as per Indian Calendar from August to December

Solution -

Create a new schedule 
Add a

2. Service Level Management
3. Problem Management
4. Knowledge Management
5. Change Management
6. Service Request
7. Asset Management + CMDB

Chapter - 8

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT 
==================

When do we need a problem ticket ?

	- A repeatitive issue
	- Frequently Issue is reported or reoccured
	- Vendor Dependency
When such kind of issues happen we need to create a problem ticket

One Problem - prerequisite 
Then based on the existing Incident


>> TO create a Problem go to that particular Incident and right click on the top and choose Create Problem 

--> Life Cycle Of a Problem 
		- New
		- Assess
		- Root Cause Analysis 
		- Fix in Progress
		- Resolved
		- Closed

>> In the Assess - In this stage the problem is Assigned to the Problem manager
>> If it is a PROBLEM the Problem Manager accepts or declines the Problem or terms as Duplicate
>> Root Cause Analysis - Analysing the Root Cause of the Problem
>> Resolve - Solving the Problem
>> Closed - The Problem is Closed
>> If we face any issues again then the Problem can be re-analysed
>> Similar Incidents can be added to Child Incidents and when the Incident is closed then all the Child Incidents are closed



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 9

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
====================

--> Benefit of Knowledge Management -
		- Knowledge Article(KA) helps Resolver team to Resolve Incidents Faster
		- KA are grouped under the Knowledge Base(KB)
		- KA Publish / Retire needs Approval


--> Use Case -
	Create a Knowledge Base : Deloitte ServiceNow Training
	Owner of this Knowledge - Uchiha Itachi

	Create Knowledge Article : Deloite ITSM Training

	We are going to learn : How to create and How to Use?

	To create this knowledge article choose the Knowledge Base first and then and then add here the 


Assignment =
		Create a Knowledge article for the the Java Installation Issue - 
		It should be placed under the IT - Java Category 
		Create and Publish --> Test and Confirm


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter - 10

CHANGE MANAGEMENT
=================

>> When there is an Infrastructure Change then Change Management comes into play 
>> In this case we need to perform Impact Analyses before the change is Implemented
>> Sometimes there may be a cost associated with it
>> Need Approval as well

-->> Types of Change Management -
	(A) Normal Change - Approval Needed
	(B) Standard Change - Pre Approved
	(C) Emergency Change - Approval Needed

--> Life Cycle of Change Request

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       
       Type             |       Normal        |      Emergency    |     Standard      |       
------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
	1. New              |          Y          |         Y         |        Y          |          
	2. Assess           |          Y          |         X         |        X          |

	5. Implement        |          Y          |         Y         |        Y          |         
	6. Review           |          Y          |         Y         |        Y          |

	8. Cancel           |          Y          |         Y         |        Y          |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Assess Phase - in the Normal Change is the Technical Approval, that is if the change is technically possible or not
until the confirmation of the Assignment Group 
CAB - Change Advisory Board 
In CAB meeting the approval of one member is enough to grant the work to be done on the next stage
The vote of the CAB needs to be unanimous, as having this kind of roll back leads to questions on the board 
and is a bad remark on the working of the board

>> Steps for Normal Change -
	- We have to enter data in the necessary fields and also select the Assignment Group 
	- We have to give the Short description / description 
	- Next is the Assess stage in which we have to wait for the approval 
				- Here we need to provide the Justification, Implementation Plan, Risk and Impact analysis, Backout Plan(Rollback Options), Test Plan
				These are mandatory fields
	- Requesting Approval - CAB Approval
	- Scheduled - Start and End Date and Time
	- Implement - We have to implement and take pictures or screenshots of the change done
	- Review - The Change will get reviewed and then it will go to the closure
	- Close - The Update is closed and the Closure Information has to be provided 
	- Canceled - If the Change was not successful then we can cancel the change and Rollback


>> Emergency Change
	- After Creating a Change Request
	- We directly go to the Approval Stage instead of the Assess Stage
	- After the CAB approval other stages similar to that of Normal Change


>> Standard Change
	- We already have few Templates
	- For New Templates - Go to Standard Change and choose My Proposal -> New
	- Create the template and Fill all the Change Request Values
	- The next Stage is the approval stage 
	- After the approval the template can be found in the New Change


>>> Standard change means there is no business impact
		Example - Someone asks for changing his own password, this does not affect the business

SERVICENOW DEVELOPMENT
======================

1. How to Start a Dev

2. How To capture Development

3. How to move the code between Instances


>>> To capture the Development we have a concept Update set

>>> 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|       Update Set                       |          Tables (Development)          |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                
| -Used to capture the development       | - Your Name Employee                   |
|  activities                            |                                        |
| - Application                          |                                        |          
| 	- Local Update Set                   |                                        |
| - Merge Update Set                     |                                        |
| - Child Update Set                     |                                        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


>> Local Update Set  - Filter Navigator
>> Update Set will start capturing the development activities only when it is current
>> Switching between the different update Sets 
		- Settings >> Developer >> Update Set >> Show Update set picker on header
		- Changing this will add the Current Update set on the Header

>> The Update Set Name and Table Name need not be the same as the update set which is in Current will capture all the Updates done 

>> When you dont want the Update the Development then make the Default as the Current Update Set as it will be captured in Garbage Values

>> History does not capture Development Activity but captures the Changes made to the Update Set 

>> Filter Navigator ->> Tables(System Definitions)

>> Changes that we can see once the Update Set is created
		- After Entering the Label The Name will automatically be filled
		- Any Custom Table created will have a Prefix - u_ is the Prefix for any Custom Table (Here u is user defined)
		- Along with the Table there are 6 fields that gets created automatically
		- In the Controls >> Access >> We already have 4 Access Controls available to us 
				- Create
				- Delete 
				- Read 
				- Write
		- Application Access - 
		- In control >> there is an option called Live Feed Option 
		- Database Index is already created
		- When Table is created and saved the Frontend and Backend (i.e Table and Form both are created)
		- The Updates made in a Development is found in the Update Set
		- Name cannot be edited once saved
		- Extend cannot be used before saving

>> In Service Now everything is Table at the Backend and Form in the Frontend
>> We can as well delete any Updates

--->> Code Movement 
		- Download and move to another instance(from Related links find Export XML)
		- Application Name - Retrive Update Set 
			- Choose the File to Import and Upload
		- Validating the Update Set - Validation is called Preview Update Set
				- Preview
				- Commit
		- Go to Filter Navigation and search for the Update set





-->> Steps from Capturing Updates and Code Movement

1. First Create an Update List and then set it to Current Update Set - Doing this will only make the Update Set to Capture the Data
2. Then if you are creating a Table --> Save the Table and Check the Update List to find the Recent Updates 
3. To Export a Update Set the Status of your Update Set must be in complete
4. Then in the recent Links we will get an Option to Export as XML
5. If we want to Import an Update Set - Go to Retrive Update Set and Select Import option
6. After Importing and Uploading we have to Validate - 
		Validation is called Preview Update Set in Service now
		We have to perform Validation to check errors 
7. We have to Preview and then Commit 
8. Go to Filter Navigator and check for the Update Set you Uploaded






>> In the Update Set Log we have many predefined logs

>> The child class can be used in a Update Set
>> Project - Employee Management
	
	- Employee pay
	- Employee Leaves
	- Employee Basic Information 
	- Employee Project Info 

 

 --> Merge the Update Set
	
	1. First Move the Child Update Set as an Individual 
	2. Then Open the Update Set and Choose Merge Update Set and Filter out whatever you dont need and Merge the Update Set


--> Update Source 
	- Refer any completed Update Set present in the source instance
	- Directly pull it from the target instance
	- No Export / Import needed 
	- Direct transfer from Dev to UAT
- This is used to lower the tedious task of Import Export .. In this we create a Update Source 
- The Update Source works like a Remote Instance

1. User Creation 
2. Give Admin Role
3. Open Update Source and type out the URL of the DEV and the User ID and Password created by DEV
4. The Retrive Completed Update Sets pulls the Update Sets from the Source
5. Then we can make a Commit to store the Update Set from the Source to our Instance



-->> Table -
		- Open the latest created Table
		- We can add new rows
		- The version under use comes with 52 Data Types
		- In the latest Tokyo Version there are 53 Data Types
	- Creating a new Row using - New button 
		- First Choose the Type like - Date, String etc....
				- Here Reference can also be used 
					For Example - The company details that comes as OOTB is a reference table to us as we have not created it
		- Then Save it and then give the column name 
		- Update the Table
		- The User Created Row comes with a Red Cross

	- Once we create a New Table and save it we cannot modify it

Assignment - 

User - David Loo 
He should be able to -
						Read, Write, Modify, Delete, the records present in the employee application 

Solution - 
	Add the Role - U_ to the User



-->> To create a role that is not system Defined we have to have an application 
-->> The Application once developed comes along with a Role

-->> Global Scope 

>>> What are the other ways of creating the Table

---> Auto Generate Employee number using Employee Details Table
	1. Go to Table 
	2. Controls -->  Auto Number 
	3. Update 

	* Here the Records created earlier will not have a Employee Number
	That is the Auto Generation is effective since the Update

--> Sys Id - Unique identifier for Records in ServiceNow (The way ServiceNow stores Record)

		- In short Aadhar Card of ServiceNow
		- Every record in ServiceNow has a Unique identifier called SYS - ID 
		- It is 32 Character Long Alpha Numeric Number

- This SYS ID remains as a constant in any given situation

How to find the SYS ID for any Record ? -
		- In our Application change User Personalized List and add all the fields necessary
		- Click the User 
		- On the Top right click and copy Sys ID and paste in notepad to see the Employee Id



Assignments -

1. Create Application to store books and its issue and returned date inside the Library Management System Software

	This Library Management System is managed by the Library Staff
	Here are the Staffs who will do the Book Keeping
			- Fred Luddy
			- Abraham Lincoln
			- Abel Tuter
	
Solution - 

	1. Create Update Set
	2. Create an Application - Library Management System
	3. Assign Roles to Librarians(Group)
	4. Test

2. We have a project 
	- Library Management System
	- Project Lead Abel Tuter has to divide following modules work between different developers
      so that all development work can be moved together

	Module
	- Books        -----> Librarian module
	- Students     |
	- Staff -------
	               |
				   -----> Helpers Module
	- Purchases

Solution - 
	1. In the Update Set Created Earlier - Create Child Set
	2. Under the Child Set - Staff - Create Librarian Module, and Helpers Module as Child Set
	3. Make Abel Tuter as Admin for this

-->> EXTENDED TABLE
	 --------------

Extensible - Creating a new table with use of the current table
			 The New Table will contain the fields of the First Table and will also have additional fields 

What are we going to learn ?

	- How to create a table by extending an existing table
	- How to add a new module under an existing application
		Example - Employee Pay module will be available under the Employee Application
	- How to manage the roles created along with the new module
	

Excercise - 

Extended Table Name : Employee Pay (2nd Table) which will be Extended from Employee Table

Solution -

1. Change the Update Set to Employee Pay
2. Go to the Emp Table Created and in controls check Extensible
3. Create New table and select the extends table as Employee
4. Add module to menu - select the Employee Application
5. Save the Table 
		- We observe that a new role was created and also the fields of previous Table gets added
6. Now opening the newly created application we can see the fields of the previous Table


Benifit of Extending the Table -
	- This ensures Data Normalization 
	- Normalization : Dont store the same data in multiple Table
					- To avoid Data Redundancy


- Point to remember 
	- Structure of the Table is copied not the Data


Assignment -

Compare the First Table and the Extended Table we have created 
Note down the differences found

Solution - 

- The Database Indexes are matched to the Main Table 
- There are Two Sys Id created 
- Every Table has its own Auto Number
	- Auto Number is turned Off
	- Example - Incident, Change, 
- Can we delete the previous table columns ?
	- If the fields are used as a reference at some other place then the system wont allow us to delete 
	- In general we must not delete the data


Can we have Two Sys ID ?
		- Create a New Record in Employee Pay
		- Copy the SYS_ID
		- Go to Main Table and Select and Copy the SYS_ID for the Same Record 

	- Here we see that The SYS_ID are same which means that 


Assignment -

Find the Source Table for the following applications 
	- Incident  -> Task
	- Change	-> Task
	- Problem 	-> Task
	- Request	-> Task
Solution - 
1. Search the name of the application in the Label
2. All the Applications will have the same Extends Table as Task


--->>> Form Design 
	   -----------


--->> How to design the UI(Form)
--->> We have created a table
		- After creating a table we were able to find 
			- Application 
			- Module
		- The form was created automatically

-->> To design Form 
	- Go to the particular TABLE and click on Design Form
	- The primary thing we find after going in the link is 
		- It is an interface using which we can add new fields
		- Select appropriate field type to be used
		- Example : Date Field, String Field, Reference, Choice ....
	- It also provides us the option to create Layout and place the fields
	- It also provides us the option to create different Form Section 
	- Provides option to add Section Headers


Excercise -

- Design the Employee Pay Form 

- Design : 		


 _______________________________                                                     ______________________________________
|________Employee ID____________|                                                   |______________Joining Date____________|

 _______________________________                                                     _____________________________________
|________Employee Name__________|                                                   |_____________Last Login Date__________|

 _______________________________                                                     ______________________________________
|__________Company______________|                                                   |_____________Employee Type____________|
																									Permanent
																									Contractual


													Bank Account Information														
 _______________________________                                                     _______________________________________
|_________Account No____________|                                                   |_______________IFSC Code_______________|

 _______________________________                                                     _______________________________________
|_________Branch _______________|								                    |______________Account Type_____________|


Solution -

- Open the Design form 
- Change the number of columns we need and accordingly drag and drop the Fields in the manner we want
- If we want to add a new section use the add button on top left
- When we want to add a new field, choose from field type and drag and drop
	- Whenever we are Changing the name while creating new field Type, the Backend value must be as per the Standard naming convention followed
	- Must be renamed before the form is saved, it cannot be renamed after the form is saved 
	- The prefix used must be u_ <field name>
	- Best Practise is to maintain lower case

- For the Branch - we add The reference field
							- The table for Location is found in cmn_location

- The Backend and Frontend are inter communicating wth each other
		- While creating the Frontend the Backend(Table Columns) are automatically updated

--> If the Sections are appearing in Tabbed Format 
		- Go to System Setting on top left
		- Forms --> Disable Tabbed Forms


--> Two methods of Form Design

	- Form Design 
	- Form Layout

-->> In the Form we want to add a field where that field is visible only to those logging in from the mobile
	- For this we have an option in Form called View
	- This must be changed to Mobile View and then the Form Design can be edited accordingly

--> Two ways of adding a new option in any of the fields

	- We can do it from the Frontend using - Form Design 
	- We can as well do it from the Form View by right clicking and configure Label

--> Configuration Item - Reference can be checked from forms in the form view right click the field and it appears 
						 Instead this can be done by going and checking in Form Design
Assignment -

Add following fields in the following Form 
	- Add Employee Image
	- Salary should be paid in Dollar
	- Salary Payment date should be entered

Solution -

- Add the Employee Image with Attachment Type 
- Salary must be in Currency 
	- We cannot use FX Currency - Forex Currency used for conversion
	- We must not add Price as it describes a selling Price
- Salary Payment Date - Use Due Date


--->> Base Table
	  ----------

>> What is a Base Table ?
>> What are the Base Table in SERVICENOW ?
>> How the Base Tables is being Extended ?

>> How many Base Table in ServiceNow ? (Most Frequently Asked Certification Question)
	- There are Two Base Table in ServiceNow
		- Task
		- CMDB

>> The Task Table has all the common Data required for other fields like 
		- Change
		- Incident
		- Problem
		- Request ....
	Further the Task Table is Extended and new fields are added wherever required
	Task Table is the Parent Table
	This helps in Normalization


Assignment - (Very Important and Useful for ServiceNow throuhout career in ServiceNow)

	- Find the Table Name for the Following Forms
		- User
		- Group 
		- Role
		- Group Membership

Solution -
		  				  Label 	  			Name					Extends Table

1. User 				- User					sys_user				(empty)
2. Group 				- Group					sys_user_group			(empty)
3. Role 				- Role					sys_user_role			Application File
4. Group Membership		- Group Member			sys_user_grmember		(empty)

--> If the Name starts with imp it is temporary
--> Group Membership - Very Important because if we want to load 5000 members we cannot do one by one, in such situation it helps



--->>> Table Prefix 
	
	- sys - System Generated
	- cmdb - Configuration Management Related
	- alm - Asset Management Related 
	- imp - Import Set Related  ---> This will be used in Data Load
	- u_  - User Defined (Custom Tables)
	- sla - Service Level Agreement



Assignment 1 -


1. Create Update set
2. Enable Extends in sys_user
3. Create Table and Extend from the sys_user Table
4. Add the Fields that does not exist
5. Edit the Form Design accordingly


Assignment 2 - 

1. Application Name - Ticket
2. Create Update Set 
3. Enable Extends in Task
4. Create New Table and Extend from Task
5. Add the fields that Does Not exist
6. Edit the Form Design accordingly


Assignment 3 - 

Create a role for the Employee Application End Users -

	- Employee_admin : Should have access to all the modules inside the Employee Application
	- Employee_payroll : Access to Employee Pay Application
	- Employee_user : Should have access to basic employee application

Solution - 

1. Update Set
2. Create New Roles With Names - Employee_admin, Employee_payroll, Employee_user
3. Assign Table Role for each of them

-->> DATA LOAD 

- We are going to learn
	- What is Load Data
	- When it is required
	- Steps followed during Data Load Process
			- Data Load Template (Preparation / Validation)
			- Import Set
			- Transform Map
				-Tools used during the Transform Map 
						- (A) Auto Map
						- (B) Mapping Assist
	- Benefits of Data Load
	- Use Case



-->> Requirement 
		- Load 100 users in the ServiceNow System as provided in the Template
	
	Pre-Requisite
		- We need a template with 100 User Records filled


>> Template - Is an Excel File with Field Headers
			- Client will provide the data in template 
			- ServiceNow Admins will use the template to load the provided data into the System


>>> How to prepare a Template 
	- Go to the ServiceNow User Application under User Administartion
	- When we click on the Top -->  We have option of Import
	- In Import we have the option to Create Excel Template
	- To import the fields that we need we have to go to Personalize List and choose all the fields we need
	- Then Download


>>> Import Set - It is staging area where the loaded data is stored until it is moved to the Target Table


--> Diagram of the Data Set 

1. We primarily have the Data Set in the Local Machine
2. Then we have the ServiceNow Cloud area
	- Inside the Cloud Area we have : Import Set (Temporary / Staging Area), Target Table
3. Target Table in this case is sys_user
4. We have to map the Fields of the Import data with the Target Table - This is called Transform Map
			- Here we either use Auto Map or Mapping Assist
5. After this the Data is Loaded in the Target Table
6. Validating by looking for the data in Target Table




>>> Load Data
	
	- Filter Navigator --> Load Data Application 
	- If we want we can create a New Import Set Table or Use Existing Table 
	- Advised to create a Table
	- Then we load the data set
	- Then we have to click Tranform Map 
		- This is a Reusable Component
	- In transform Map we have to add the Target Table Name 
	- Then we have to click the Auto Map Matching Fields
		- This will Map the Fields from the Table to the Target Table 
	- If the Mapping is not done properly and for Manually Mapping we have to 
		- Mapping Assist : Bring the Unmatched field from Left and Map with the field on the right 
		- The Mapping will appear in the middle
	- Now hit the Transform 
	- One Table can have many Transform Maps
--> Data is now loaded Successfully 
-- If we need to check the Tranform History, Import Log and Import Set for this Data Load 

>> If we hit the Submit button before we Auto Map - In filter Navigator - Search Transform Map and choose Administartion - Transform Maps



--->> Please Update the existing records and create those records which does not exist with reference to the provided data

Solution -

Similar to last Steps do till Mapping Assist and Save
Important -  

>>> Coalesce - Defining the Unique identifier
			   Example - User id is defined as Coalesce that means system is instructed to find and update the record if it exists
			   			 If it does not exist then system creates a new record
			There can be More than one Coalesce

			Then Transform 
				- In Transform we have the Updated as well as the New one 
				- Choose the NEW One and hit Transform 
			
	Validate using sys_user Table 


** Difference between Update Set vs Import Set - 


Run Transform - Is used when we are adding some more data but keeping the Template same 
				

1. Edit the Excel with some additional data 
2. Then Load Data of the updated Excel
3. Run Transform 
4. Check the Transform Map and Click Transform 
5. Validate this in the User Table



Project 1 -

- Implement New Customer - Company Name : Rebooted
- Company will have the following "Foundation Data"	-
		- Company
		- Departments - 20 Departments
			- Department Names : RBT DEPT-01 till RBT DEPT-20
		- Teams - 50 Teams
			- RBT GRP-01 till RBT GRP-50
		- Users - 1000
			- Rebooted 01 till Rebooted 1001
		- User Roles
		- Location - 10 Location 
			- Location Names : RBT LOC-01 till RBT LOC-10
		
	Rebooted 01 to Rebooted 100 --> RBT GRP-01


Solution -

1. Search Company in Filter Navigation - User Administartion - Companies
2. Create a company with name - Rebooted
3. Create a template in a single Excel sheet for each of the Foundation Data
4. Add the Data in all the necessary fields 
5. Common fields must have the same data throughout the Excel
6. Load the Data 
7. Map each sheet and Transform 
8. Validate in the Respective Tables


-->> 
--> Task - Share Company with each other
Solution:
	- Importing Company Name from XML File
	- Checking the Sys Id
	- The ID is same and also the data is protected in this case


**	To Shift the DATA between diffrent instancs is possible, firstly create find the data
    which is to be shifted and then convert it to XML format, once that is done,
    it can be shared to other instance as well.

    To load an instance, go to the column header and then right-click and select
    import, this will allow the import of the data, through an XML format

	    
>>> Automated User Creation

LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

- It is a central repository of all the user related Information
- It can be integrated with the serviceNow and other systems

>> Benefits - Creation of Users and their access can be Automated


>>> User creation Process - 

Create new LDAP Server
	- Here automatically Groups and Users are created

CMDB - Configuration Management Database(Heart of ITSM)

>> What does it store ?

- It stores CI's and its Relationships


>> Filter Navigator - Assets -> All Assets

>> How to create an Asset ?

- Click on New
	- We have 4 types of Asset
	- If we want to add we have Edit Interceptor 
	- Choose the Model Category and Model

In Hardware CI 
- Primary Identifier is the Serial Number (Mandatory after choosing the Model)

	- After giving the Asset Number and Serial Number
	- Saving it will show 
		- Display Name - It is the combination of Asset Tag and Model
		- CI - This utomatically gets created once an asset is created  - It is the combination of Serial Number and Model


Asset Management Life Cycle - 
	State of the Asset
		- On Order
		- In Stock 
		- In transit
		- In use
		- In maintenance
		- Retired 
		- Missing
		- Build



--> Out of Syllabus

	- ITOM 
		- Discovery Tools - There are different Discovery Tools avaailable
		- These tools can scan the entire network and populate the CMDB
		- Example of Discovery Tools
			- ServiceNow Discovery
			- BMC Discovery
			- Device42



>>> Tables and its Relationships

Very Important


>> CI Class Manager 

- Search for CI Class Manager 
- Check the Hirarchy
- In Hirarchy --> Hardware --> Server --> Windows Server
									  --> Linux Server
									  --> Other Server

- The Name of the Tables stored is like a branching from the CMDB Table 


- Avoiding Duplication 

	- Here Serial Number is Unique Identifier for a Hardware asset


- Assignment

	- Load the Data provided by the Client 
	- The Data File contains 100 Linux Servers 
	- Load them and Confirm

Solution -

1. Load Data 
2. Give Coalesce as name
3. Check Linux - under Servers


- Assignment

	- Create a Load File to Load 50 Network Gears
	- The name of Network Gears should be : RBT-NetworkGear-01 till RBT-NetworkGear-50
	- Serial Number is same as the Name
	- Load the Data and Confirm

Solution - 

1. cmdb_ci_netgear



>> CMDB - Health

1. It is a Dashboard which showcases the Health Status of our CMDB

> Go to CMDB View
> Populating Data
	> CMDB Health Dashboard Jobs
		- Active = True 
		- Execute Now

The More the health of CMDB it is good

>> Go to the Duplicate and click any one of the Duplicate Task and do Remediate

--> Most Related Items
--> Newest Updated - This must be Kept as we have the Updated One 
--> Oldest Created

--> Discovery Tool finds and updates the New one so we keep the new 
	This also depends on situation



>>> Assignment - 

	Run the De-Duplication process for the Printer CI'
	Clean the 26 Duplicates showing on the CMDB View Dashboard
